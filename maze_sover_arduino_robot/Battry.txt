Battery

I used 12v Battery with 1000 mAh.

The table Above shows how the voltage drops when the battery discharge.
you should keep it in mind and you have to recharge the battery constantly.

Discharge time is basically the Ah or mAh rating divided by the current.

So for a 1000mAh battery with a load that draws 300mA you have:

1000/300 = 3.3 hours

If you drain more current the time will decrease and so on.

Note: Make sure that you don't exceed the Battery Discharge Current or it will be damaged.

Also again make a common Ground and connect all GNDs to it ( sensors, Arduino, Driver ) all grounds should be connected.
