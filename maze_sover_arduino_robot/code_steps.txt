Code flow:

defining the pins
defining output and input pins
check sensors' readings
use sensors' reading to define walls
check first route (if it was left then follow the left wall, if it's right follow the right wall)
Use PID to avoid hitting the walls and to control motors' speed
You can use this code but change the pins and the constant numbers to get the best results.
